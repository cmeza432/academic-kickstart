Want to watch a movie you never heard of. Well come and use my movie recommender app to help and find movies
similar to some of your favorites. This may start out strictly only involving horror movies since I love the 
horror genre. Just type in the movie and it will bring up a list of movies that are similar that you may like! 
The first iteration will invole about 1 MB of data that involves roughly 100k rating for 9k movies. The end 
iteration will have the bigger dataset around 190 MB with 2M ratings of about 27k movies. The dataset used is 
movielens and link is here: http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-latest-README.html.
