title = "Movie Recommender App" 
+++

This movie recommender app uses practices from the Data Mining Field to use different methods for information retrieval. The webapp will use a Text Search, Classifier and Image Captioning to return results based on user input. It will run using Python Flask version 1.1.1. This will be done in three different iteration.

Deployment:

Need to have Python Flask Version 1.1.1 or higher. To install just run on a terminal the command 
pip install flask. Once envrionment is set up, then you can run in a terminal and get the local host link to test out
from the machine locally.
