Want to watch a movie you never heard of. Well come and use my movie recommender app to help and find movies
similar to some of your favorites. Just type in the movie and it will bring up a list of movies that are similar that 
you may like! I will be using the IMDB movie review dataset which includes over 50k reviews of both good and bad reviews.

Dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/iarunava/imdb-movie-reviews-dataset
